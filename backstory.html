  <p><h1>Meet Mischa.</h1></p><br><center>
  
Born in Miami, Florida, Mischa has been doing her sisters makeup since she was a toddler. Fast forward to high school, her peers were constantly asking her to do homecoming makeup, and even bridal. She realized the requests for makeup artistry would never stop, so why should she? She went on to become a certified makeup artist in 2010 and has done over 1,000 bridal parties, homecomings, proms, and so on.<br> Mischa truly relishes the art and loves making women feel like queens.
